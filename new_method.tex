\section{New Method}
\subsection{Problem summary}
For multi-core chip in dark silicon era, cores on the chip can not be all turned on at the same time due to the
thermal constraint. In order to make full use of the chip resources, we need to decide the number of active cores as
well as the corresponding specific distribution that lead to maximum chip performance. Usually, we can use the frequency
for performance measurement. Which should be noticed is that, active cores on the chip may not run at its maximum supply voltage
and frequency, instead, it can be applied with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling(DVFS).
\subsection{Relation between voltage and frequency}
Actually, the operating frequency of core is decided by its supply voltage, following equation can be used to shows the dependency
of frequency on voltage:
\begin{equation}\label{v_and_f}
f \propto (V-V_{th})^{\gamma}/V.
\end{equation}
Where $V$ is the transistor's supply, $V_{th}$ is the threshold voltage, $f$ is the operating frequency and the exponent
$\gamma$ is an experimentally derived constant decided by the process of chip.

With the above equation, we can further develop a linear equation relating frequency and voltage. First, we normalize the
voltage and frequency to their maximum values as $V_{norm}=V/V_{max}$ and $f_{norm}=f/f_{max}$, then we can approximate a linear
relationship with following equation:
\begin{equation}\label{V_and_f_linear}
V_{norm} = \beta_1+\beta_2 \cdot f_{norm},
\end{equation}
where $\beta_1=V_{th}/V_{max}$ and $\beta_2=1-\beta_1$, value of $\beta_1$ can be considered to be around \SI{0.4} for typical process\cite{Taylor:MICRO'13}.
From this equation, we can recognize that the frequency will have to be reduced to zero when supply voltage is reduced to $V_{th}$,
which surely becomes the lower bound of voltage in DVFS operation.
\subsection{Problem formulation}
Power of cores on the chip can be divided to be dynamic power $p_d$ and static power $p_s$, where
\begin{equation}\label{pd_ps}
\begin{split}
p_d&=A C V^2 f, \\
p_s&=V I_{leak},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where A is the fraction of gates actively switching and C is the total capacitance load of all gates, $I_{leak}$ is the leakage current of
core.
Assume the dynamic power and static power with no DVFS of cores are $P_{d_0}=[p_{d_{0_1}},p_{d_{0_2}},\ldots,p_{d_{0_l}}]^ \mathrm{ T }$
$P_{s_0}=[p_{s_{0_1}},p_{s_{0_2}},\ldots,p_{s_{0_l}}]^ \mathrm{ T }$, where $p_{d_{0_i}}$ and $p_{s_{0_i}}$ are dynamic power and static power
of i-th core respectively. When DVFS is performed, assume the voltage scaling ratio of the i-th core is $\alpha_i$, then according to \eqref{V_and_f_linear},
the corresponding scaling ratio of frequency is $\theta_i = (\alpha_i-\beta_1)/\beta_2$, so the scaling ratio of dynamic power is $\lambda_i=\alpha_i^2 \theta_i$, according
to \eqref{pd_ps}. For static power, the effect of voltage and frequency scaling is much less than dynamic power, and its scaling ratio can be considered
as $\alpha_i^\kappa$, where $\kappa$ is a process-related constant, for simplicity sake, we can assume $\kappa=1$, in other words, we can ignore
the effect of leakage's dependency on voltage. Also, we use Boolean variable $\xi_i \in \left\{0,1\right\}$ to represent the i-th core is active or
not: $\xi_i=0$ represents inactive and $\xi_i=1$ represents active situation.

As mentioned before, we could use operating frequency to measure the performance of cores, and DVFS operation determine the real frequency, our
optimization goal can be expressed as $\sum_{i=1}^l \xi_i \theta_i f_{max_i}$. Because the main limit of chip performance is the cooling capacity,
so we can express the steady temperature use thermal model and let it under the temperature threshold:
$G^{-1} B \xi \left( \Lambda P_{d_0} + \alpha P_{s_0} \right) \prec T_{th}$.
Where $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{l \times l} $, $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^{l \times l} $ and $\xi \in \mathbb{R}^{l \times l}$ are all diagonal matrices,
their i-th diagonal element are $\lambda_i$, $\alpha_i$ and $\xi_i$ respectively. $\prec$ is vector inequality, for m-dimensional vector, $u$ and $v$,
$u \prec v$ represents that $u_i < v_i$ for $i = 1$,$2$,$\ldots$,$m$.

Finally, we can express the whole optimization problem using following equation:

%\begin{equation}\label{optimal_problem}
%\begin{aligned}
%%&\max\,\, \sum_{i=1}^l \xi_i \theta_i f_{max_i}\\
%\text{maximize}\,\,  &\sum_{i=1}^l \xi_i \theta_i f_{{max}_i}
%\begin{cases}
%&G^{-1} B \xi \left( \Lambda P_{d_0}+ \alpha P_{s_0} \right) \prec T_{max}\\
%&\alpha_i \in \left(0,1\right], i=1,2,\ldots,l  \\
%&\xi_i \in \left\{0,1\right\}, i=1,2,\ldots,l
%\end{cases}
%\begin{aligned}
%\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{maximize} \,\, &\sum_{i=1}^l \xi_i \theta_i f_{max_i}\\
\text{subject to}
&\begin{cases}
G^{-1} B \xi \left( \Lambda P_{d_0}+ \alpha P_{s_0} \right) \prec T_{th} \\
\alpha_i \in \left(0,1\right], i=1,2,\ldots,l  \\
\xi_i \in \left\{0,1\right\}, i=1,2,\ldots,l
\end{cases}
\end{split}
\end{equation}



Solving this optimization problem, we can get the best $\alpha_i$ and $\xi_i$, then get the best number and distribution of active cores using the number of
non-zero elements in $\xi$, and also get the power budget of cores with the value of $\alpha_i$.
A basic solution for the above equation is to traverse all possible values of $\lambda_i$, $\alpha_i$ and $\xi_i$ of all cores under the thermal limit,
and choose the values that result in maximum total performance. However, although this method can allow us to find the optimal solution, the time consumption
is unacceptable, with number of cores increasing, this method will soon be useless.
\subsection{Problem approximation}
First, for a certain core on the chip, we consider the relation between the total power $p_{tot_{i}}$ and the scaling ratio of operating frequency 
$\theta_i$:
\begin{equation}\label{p_tot and theta} 
\begin{split}
p_{tot_{i}} &=p_d + p_s\\
&= (\beta_{2} \theta_{i} + \beta_{1})^2 \theta_{i} p_{d_{0_i}} + (\beta_2 \theta_i + \beta_1) p_{s_{0_i}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}  
It is easy to see that $\theta_i$ and $p_{tot_{i}}$ are third-order related, and $\theta_i$ will monotonically increase as 
$P_{tot_{i}}$ increase. We also test this relationship for a certain chip and get the result as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:p_tot_f}, and we 
can see that these two variables are approximately of linear relation. 
What is more, we can easily prove that for a certain dark-silicon chip under a thermal constraint $T_{th}$ and certain number of active cores, 
the summary of total power of all active cores $\sum_{i=1}^l p_{tot_{i}}$ will achieve the maximum value just when temperatures of all active cores achieve $T_{th}$.  

Inspired by these two facts, if we assume that $p_{tot_{i}}$ and $\theta_i$ are just linearly related, then we can change our optimal goal to be $\sum_{i=1}^l p_{tot_{i}}$ 
while keeping the constraint conditions. 
Thus, we can take some advantages from this approximation and simplify the solving process. When the number of active cores is fixed as $m$, as well as the detail 
distribution of these $m$ active cores, which means the matrix $\xi$ is fixed ,too. 
Let $A=G^{-1} B \xi$ and we can simplify the first constraint condition in \eqref{optimal_problem} as $A p_{tot} \prec T_{th}$, where $p_{tot}=[p_{{tot}_{1}},p_{{tot}_{2}},\ldots,p_{{tot}_{l}}]^ \mathrm{ T }$.
Assume the $m$ columns of $A$ corresponding to these fixed $m$ active cores are collected into matrix $A_m \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times l}$, and the total 
power budget of them are expressed as vector $P{{tot}_m} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times 1}$. Then, we can form the following optimization problem to describe the approximated problem:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
%&\min\,\,  \left\|T_{max}-A_m P_m\right\|_2 \\
\text{minimize} \,\, &\left\|T_{th}-A_m P_{{tot}_m}\right\|_2 \\
\text{subject to}\,\, &A_m P_{{tot}_m} \prec T_{th}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This optimization problem can be equivalently transformed into a quadratic programming (QP) problem as
\begin{equation}\label{optimal_simple}
\begin{split}
%&\min\,\,  \left\|T_{max}-A_m P_m\right\|_2 \\
\text{minimize} \,\, &p_{{tot}_m}^\mathrm{T} A_m A_m p_{{tot}_m}^\mathrm{T}-2 T_{th}^\mathrm{T} A_m p_{{tot}_m}^\mathrm{T} + T_{th}^\mathrm{T} T_{th}  \\
\text{subject to}\,\, &A_m P_{{tot}_m} \prec T_{th}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which can be solved efficiently by calling the standard QP solving routines for the power budget $P_{{tot}_m}$. With $p_{{tot}_m}$, we can 
easily calculate the maximum chip performance for these fixed active-core number $m$ and fixed active-core distribution. 

Based on these derivation, we can generate a better method to solve the original problem: we can go through all possible active-core numbers and all possible 
distributions for a certain chip and calculate the corresponding performance, and choose the one result in global maximum total performance as the best 
solution. This improved method can save some time of testing all possible value of $\alpha_i$ and $\lambda_i$ when $m$ and $\xi$ are fixed by directly 
calculate the maximum chip performance using \eqref{optimal_simple}, but the cost of going through all possible active-core numbers and active-core distributions 
are still huge and make it hard to be realized.     

\subsection{use greedy algorithm to solve the optimization problem}


To reduce the time cost and find a acceptable approximate solution, we propose a greedy algorithm to replace the ergodic method.
For a chip with $m$ total cores, the basic idea of our proposed greedy algorithm can be described as follow: first we find a sub-optimal distribution for each active
core number from \SI{1} to $m$, together with the total chip performance, then compare the chip performance with different number of active cores and get
the best active-core number which result in best chip performance, as well as the corresponding distribution.

The details of finding sub-optional for certain active-core number $m$ is as follow: we first find the optimal solution for only one active core. Then, we keep
the first active core position determined by first step, and find the optimal solution of two cores, with the second active core position determined. Such strategy
will be iteratively processed for $m$ steps, and finally we can arrive at a sub-optimal solution for $m$ active cores.

Naturally, the first active position affect the subsequent active positions a lot, especially when the total active-core
number $m$ is small. That is because the first active core will determine the second position and thus the 3rd one, ...
untill the last one. A natural idea to relieve this is to add more choices for the starting position instead of only the
optimal one, then start from different core position to find the sub-optimal distribution for the certain active-core
number $m$, at last,  compare the total performance resulted by different beginning position and finally determine the
best distribution for active cores.
%\subsubsection{ Application of symmetry for initial active core search}
Take the actual situation as a reference, we can make a reasonable assumption that the cores on the chip are distributed as square form. Cores distributed in
this particular distribution form has strong symmetry, which enable us to decrease the choices of the first active core
position without losing completeness, and thus save a lot time to find the sub-optional distrubution for certain
active-core number.

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:symmetry}, we can take a 16-core chip as example, which has only three different positions when determine
the first active core when the symmetry of cores are considered. And it is easy to realize that for a chip with $n
\times n$ cores, the different number of positions for first active core is just $(\bar{n}^2+\bar{n})/2$, where
$\bar{n}$=$\lceil n/2 \rceil$.
\subsection{Temporary experimental result}
We test our greedy algorithm on a chip with $4 \times 4$ cores and get some acceptable experimental results as we
excepted. Fig.~\ref{fig:performance_compare} shows the comparison of our new method and the basic ergodic method in finding the maximum total
performance when a certain number of active cores is given. It is clear that the result of our new method is nearly the
same as that of the time consuming ergodic method. We also show the distribution given by these two methods when the
active-core number is \SI{10}, which result in the maximum total performance for this 16-core chip just as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:dis_compare}, as we can see, the two distribution are just the same because of the symmetry of cores.
As for time cost, the ergodic method takes \SI{13.507}s to go through all possible active-core numbers and distributions
while our greedy method only cost \SI{0.056}s.
