\section{Power and Thermal Models}\label{sec:power_therm_model}

In this section, we present the power and thermal models used in this work. 
% In order to determine the energy-efficient power budget of a multi-core dark silicon system, the 
% we present power modeling and thermal modeling techniques in this section, which are important basic knowledges for our new work.

\subsection{Power model}\label{sec:power_model}

The total power of a chip, denoted as $p$, is composed of dynamic power and static power. The dynamic power, denoted as $p_d$, depends on the activities of the chip, which is expressed as
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:dyn_power}
% p_{d} = \alpha_{d} \cdot V_{dd}^{2} \cdot f,
% \end{equation}
% where $V_{dd}$ stands for the operating voltage, $f$ stands for the clock frequency, and $\alpha_{d}$ is defined as:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha_d}
% \alpha_{d} = \frac{p_{d_{max}}}{V_{max}^{2}f_{max}},
% \end{equation}
% in which $p_{d_{max}}$ is the dynamic power when the core is at the maximum clock frequency $f_{max}$ and maximum operating voltage $V_{max}$.

% It is assumed the clock frequency $f$ changes with $V_{dd}$ to the lowest allowable point:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:f_v}
% f = (V_{dd}-V_{th}) \cdot (\frac{f_{max}-f_{min}}{V_{max}-V_{th}})+f_{min}.
% \end{equation}
% where $f_{min}$ stands for the minimum clock frequency, and $V_{th}$ stands for the threshold voltage.

% Yet the static power $p_{s}$ of the chip is caused by leakage current $I_{leak}$ as:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:sta_power}
% p_{s} = \alpha_{s}\cdot V_{dd} \cdot I_{leak},
% \end{equation}
% where $\alpha_{s}$ is defined as:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha_s}
% \alpha_{s} = \frac{p_{s_{max}}}{V_{max}\cdot I_{max}},
% \end{equation}
% in which $p_{s_{max}}$ is the static power when the core is running at thermal limit, and $I_{max}$ is the corresponding maximum leakage current. Due to the non-linear relationship between $I_{leak}$ and temperature, static power is also sensitive to temperature, which makes it hard to obtain.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dyn_power}
p_{d} = C_{e} \cdot V_{dd}^{2} \cdot f,
\end{equation}
where $V_{dd}$ stands for the operating voltage, $f$ is the clock frequency, and $C_{e}$ is the effective switching capacitance.

In equation~\eqref{eq:dyn_power}, the clock frequency $f$ and the operating voltage $V_{dd}$ of each modern processor core are changed at runtime (widely known as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)), in order to adjust the core's energy efficiency and performance. 
A widely used model to discribe such relationship between $f$ and $V_{dd}$ is [cite ???]
\begin{equation}\label{eq:f_v}
f = (V_{dd}-V_{th}) \cdot (\frac{f_{max}-f_{min}}{V_{max}-V_{th}})+f_{min}.
\end{equation}
where $f_{min}$ and $f_{max}$ stands for the minimum and maximum clock frequencies, respectively, $V_{th}$ stands for the threshold voltage, and $V_{max}$ stands for ???.

The static power $p_{s}$ of the chip is caused by leakage current $I_{leak}$ as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sta_power}
p_{s} =V_{dd} \cdot I_{leak}.
\end{equation}
Due to the nonlinear relationship between $I_{leak}$ and temperature, static power is also sensitive to temperature. $I_{leak}$ is composed mainly by the subthreshold current and gate current~\cite{Liu:DATE'07,ShenTan:TODAES'12,WangWan:TOC'18}, therefore $I_{leak}$ can be approximated as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:leakage}
I_{leak}=I_{sub}+I_{gate}.
\end{equation}

In~\eqref{eq:leakage}, $I_{gate}$ is considered as a constant because it does not depend on temperature~\cite{WangWan:TOC'18}. Whereas $I_{sub}$ is nonlinearly related to temperature. It can be approximated using a linear model $I_{lin}$ based on Taylor expansion as~\cite{WangWan:TOC'18}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sub_current_lin}
  \begin{split}
    I_{sub} \approx & I_{lin} \\
     =& K (\frac{k_b}{q})^2 e^{\frac{q(V_{GS}-V_{th})}{\eta k_b
    T_{p_0}}}\\
&\times ({T_{p_0}}^2 + (2T_{p_0} - \frac{q(V_{GS}-V_{th})}{\eta
  k_b})(T_p-T_{p_0})).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $k_b$ is the Boltzmann constant, $q$ is the elementary charge, $T_{p}$ is a scalar representing temperature at one place,~\footnote{$T$
introduced latter in~\eqref{eq:therm_model} is a vector representing temperatures at multiple positions} $K$ and $\eta$ are
process related parameters, $V_{th}$ is the threshold voltage, and $T_{p_0}$ is the Taylor expansion point.

By combing equations \eqref{eq:sta_power}, \eqref{eq:leakage}, and \eqref{eq:sub_current_lin}, we obtain the final static power model in scaler form as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sta_power_lin}
\begin{split}
p_s&=V_{dd}I_{leak}\\
&=V_{dd} (I_{lin}+I_{gate})\\
&=V_{dd}(a_p T_p + I_0),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $a_pT_p$ is the term formulated by combing all terms (linearly) associated with $T_p$ in \eqref{eq:sub_current_lin},
$I_{0}$ contains constant terms that are not associated with $T_p$ in \eqref{eq:sub_current_lin} and the gate leakage $I_{gate}$.

% \begin{equation}\label{eq:lin_leakage}
% p_{s} =V_{dd} (p_{0}+a_{s} \cdot T).
% \end{equation}
% $p_{0}$ is a constant terms that are not associated with $T$, $a_{s}$ is the coefficient associated with $T$. $P_{0}$ and $A_{s}$ are the constants corresponding for $p_{0}$ and $a_{s}$ in vector/matrix form.


%Apparently, the leakage current has a complex relationship with temperature. In this work, we use \eqref{eq:sta_power}, \eqref{eq:leakage}, and \eqref{eq:sub_current} to model the static power considering such relationship. The parameters of leakage current can be obtained by curve fitting using HSPICE simulation data. In order to see the accuracy of the model used, Fig.~\ref{fig:leakage} shows an HSPICE simulation result of leakage using TSMC \SI{65}{nm} process model and its curve fitting result using approximate leakage model. From the figure, we can see that the static power model has high accuracy for all common temperatures of IC chips.

\subsection{Thermal model}\label{sec:therm_model}
Because leakage power is highly related to temperature, thermal
model is needed to connect the temperature and power.
In this work, we build the thermal model of a multi-core dark silicon system packaged in a common structure in Fig.~\ref{fig:chip_struct}. 
Heat (power) generated from the chip is conducted through thermal interface material (TIM), heat spreader, heat sink, and finally dissipated to the air through convection.
% The secondary heat path is ignored, since much fewer heat is dissipated through that path.

To build the thermal model, we first divide the chip and its package
into multiple blocks called thermal nodes, with partition granularity
determined by the accuracy requirements. For the dark silicon
multi-core system (as an example, the floorplan of a 16-core chip is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:core_flp}), we treat each core as a thermal node,
because each core has small area and highly correlated internal power
distribution. The other thermal nodes from the package are divided
according to the thermal nodes. Power (including both dynamic power
and static power) of each core is modeled as a current source from the
ground to the thermal node of the core. Then, the thermal resistance
and capacitance among these thermal nodes are determined, which model
the thermal transport and power response behaviors. Please note that
multi-core systems with floorplans different from the one shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:core_flp} are fully compatible with this work, and each
core's internal structure can also be modeled if necessary. By
following the modeling policies provided above, the thermal model for
a chip with $n$ total thermal nodes is generated in ordinary
differential equations as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:therm_model}
\begin{split}
GT(t) + C\frac{dT(t)}{dt} &= BP(t)\\
T_{c}(t) &= B^{T}T(t)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $T(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is the temperature rise vector,
representing temperature rise (from the ambient temperature) of the $m$
thermal nodes of the chip and package;\footnote{To be specific, there are $n$ chip thermal
nodes and $m-n$ package thermal nodes.} $G \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$
and  $C \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ contain equivalent thermal
resistance and capacitance information respectively; $B \in
\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ stores the information of how powers are
injected into the thermal nodes; $P(T, t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the
power vector, which contains power consumptions of the $n$ cores on
chip, including both dynamic power $P_d$ and static power vector
$P_s$, i.e., there is $P(T, t)=P_s(T, t)+P_d(t)$. $T_{c}(t) = [T_1,
T_2, \ldots, T_n]^T \in
\mathbb{R}^n$ is the output temperature vector, containing only
temperatures of the $n$ cores only, with $T_i$ representing the
temperature of the $i$-th core. For the detailed structures of $G$, $C$,
and $B$ matrices, please refer to the thermal modeling works such
as~\cite{Huang:TVLSI'06,Huang:TC'08,WangTan:TODAES'13,Hanumaiah:TCAD'11}.
