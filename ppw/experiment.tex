\section{EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS}
In this section, we show the experimental results to verify the proposed power budgeting method and analyze its energy efficiency and performance. All data are collected on a PC with Intel I5 2400 CPU and 2 GB memory. Multi-core systems with core number ranging from $9$ to $100$ are used in the experiment, and each core with different dark silicon ratio are tested. The thermal models of these multi-core systems are extracted from HotSpot with default package and chip parameters. The ambient temperature are set to be \SI{20}{\degreeCelsius} for all test cases, and the temperature constraint is \SI{95}{\degreeCelsius}.
