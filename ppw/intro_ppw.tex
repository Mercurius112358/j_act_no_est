\section{Introduction}
In the coming many-core era, due to the tight power budget, power efficiency is cricital for multi-core chip design. In the previous work by Dong Hyuk Woo, evaluation of energy efficiency on the basis of performance and power (PPW) models is developed, which shows the tendency of PPW with number of cores. However, due to the dependency of leakage current on temperature and the prevalence of DVFS and dark silicon in multicore processor, the speedup potential given by existing extending methods of Amdahl's law no longer works out. In this paper, We implement dark silicon and thermal model into the evaluation of PPW to provide an alternative suitable with the dark silicon era.
