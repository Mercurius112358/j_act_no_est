In the coming many-core era, due to the tight power budget, power efficiency is cricital for
many-core processor design. In the previous work by Dong Hyuk Woo, evaluation of energy
efficiency on the basis of performance and power (PPW) models is developed, which shows the
tendency of PPW with number of cores. We implement the dark silicon and thermal model into the
evaluation of PPW to gain a better understanding of PPW in the dark silicon era.

Amdahl's law put an upper bound for the speedup that a symmetric multi-core processor can achieve by parallelization as:
\begin{equation}\label{speedup}
Perf = \frac{1} {(1-f)+f/n}
\end{equation}
where  $n$ is the number of cores, and $f$ is the fraction of a program's execution time that is parallelizable (0<$f$<1). Noted that, (1) is purely theroretical for it doesn't consider any constraints such as power budget.



It is widely acknowledged that the total power of a chip is composed of dynamic and 
static power. The dynamic power is dependent on the activities of the chip, therefore it's 
easily estimated by methods such as performance counter.
Yet the static power $p_{s}$ of the chip is mainly affected by temperature, for it's caused by
leakage current $I_{leak}$ as
\begin{equation}\label{ps}
p_{s} = V_{dd}I_{leak}
\end{equation}

Due to the non-linear relationship between $I_{leak}$ and temperature, $p_{s}$ cannot be
calculated directly. The iteration method is traditionally implemented to solve such problems.

The average power consumption of the many-core processor is as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{average_power}
W = \frac{P_{1} \times (1-f)+P_{n} \times f/n}{(1-f)+f/n}
\end{equation}

$P_{1}$ is the power consumption during the sequential computation phase, $P_{n}$ is the power 
consumption during the parallel computation phase. 

$Perf/W$ of a many-core processor is expressed as

\begin{equation}\label{ppw}
\begin{split}
\frac{Perf}{W} &= \frac{1}{(1-f)+f/n} \times \frac{(1-f)+f/n}{P_{1} \times (1-f)+P_{n} \times f/n}\\
&= \frac{1}{P_{1} \times (1-f)+P_{n} \times f/n}
\end{split}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Power consumption with thermal constraints}
$P_{n}$ is made up of the power consumption of n active cores. Please note that in dark silicon
era, $P_{n} = nk$ is not the correct expression. Due to thermal constraint, Dynamic Voltage and
Frequency Scaling(DVFS) is necessary for Thermal Design Power(TDP) consideration. As a result,
the power consumption of each of the core may decrease with the increase of the number of active cores.
From xx, we have
\begin{equation}\label{gt=bp}
(G - B_{c}A_{s})T(t) + C\frac{dT(t)}{dt}= B_{c}(P_{d}(t) + P_{0})
\end{equation}

By applying thermal model, the effect of temperature on cores can be introduced. 
Through ergodic method, the distribution of light core with the maximum PPW
for number of light core from 1 to n can be specified.

In (2) and (3), $P_{1}$ is consisted of the power consumption of n-1 idle cores and 1 active 
core. The expression of $P_{1} = 1+(n-1)k$ is not implemented, for the power consumption of 
idle cores and active core is not consistant, due to the influence of the temperature.

By appending idle core model into the above mentioned thermal model, the distribution of idle
core and active core with the maximum PPW for number of light core from 1 to n can be specified.

\section{New Method}
In order to estimate the performance-per-watt of a multi-core chip for different number of active cores and various active core distributions, we first propose an iteration based full-chip power estimation method, which can apply the thermal model into the analysis of performance-per-watt of multi-core chips. Furthermore, a non-iteration based method is proposed, which can implement local linearization to avoid time-consuming iterations. Additionally, a greedy based method can be integrated into the non-iteration based power estimation method to achieve further acceleration.


\subsection{Iteration based leakage-aware power estimation}
Because of the dependency of static power on temperature, it's not straightforward to compute the static power and temperature of next steady state based on current static power and temperature. Iteration method can be implemented to solve such problem, the computation flow is shown in Fig.x.

The initial value of $P^0_s(T,t+h)$ is a guess we provide based on the process technology. The temperature distribution $T(t+h)^0$ can be calculated with such guess. $P^1_s(T,t+h)$, the static power of next time step is updated with $T(t+h)^0$. Next, the temperature distribution $T(t+h)^1$ can be derived from $P^1_s(T,t+h)$, which concludes one iteration loop. Such iteration goes on until the convergence test is satisfied as $\parallel P^i_s(T,t+h)$-$P^(i-1)_s(T,t+h)\parallel<\epsilon$. Finally, the static power and temperature of steady state is outputted.

The iteration based method can produce an accurate outcome providing the $\epsilon$ is chosen to be small enough, yet the computing time is a serious problem, especially when the number of cores is large enough.


\subsection{Local linearized thermal model}
The major difficulty of calculating leakage-aware power estimation comes from the nonlinear thermal model shown in (x), which is caused by the nonlinear relation between subthreshold current and temperature.

To reduce the long computing time caused by iteration method, the leakage current $I_{leak}$ can be linearized to eliminate the non-linearity between $p_{s}$ and temperature, thus accelerating the computation.

Taylor expansion is performed on the original $I_{leak}$ model at a expansion point $T_{0}$. Thus the linearized relation of $I_{leak}$ and temperature is obtained as:

\begin{equation}\label{linear_subthreshold}
\begin{split}
I_{sub} = &K(\frac{k}{q})^{2}e^(\frac{q(V_{GS}-V{th})}{\eta kT_{p0}}\\
&\times (T_{p0}^{2}+(2T_{p0}-\frac{q(V_{GS}-V_{th})}{\eta k})(T_{p}-T_{p0}))\\
&+ o[(T_{p}-T_{p0})^{2}],
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $o[(T_{p}-T_{p0})^{2}]$ is the remainder. By ignoring the remainder, the linearized $I_{sub}$, denoted as $I_{lin}$ can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}\label{linear_subthreshold}
\begin{split}
I_{lin} = &K(\frac{k}{q})^{2}e^(\frac{q(V_{GS}-V{th})}{\eta kT_{p0}}\\
&\times (T_{p0}^{2}+(2T_{p0}-\frac{q(V_{GS}-V_{th})}{\eta k})(T_{p}-T_{p0})).
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Provided the actual temperature value $T_{p}$ is close to the reference temperature point $T_{p0}$, the approximation accuracy of $I_{lin}$ can be guaranteed. From previous research, it has been shown that due to the characteristic of today's semiconductor process, such local linear approximation of leakage current has high accuracy around the expansion point.

\subsection{Non-iteration based power estimation}
The relation between static power and temperature in linear form can also be achieved as:
\begin{equation}\label{linear_static}
\begin{split}
p_{s} &= V_{dd}I_{leak}\\
&= V_{dd} \times (I_{lin}+I_{gate})\\
&= V_{dd} \times (I_{lin}(T_{p})+I_{const})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The linearized static power equation in matrix form is
\begin{equation}\label{linear_static_matrix}
P_{s} = P_{0}+A_{s}T
\end{equation}


\subsection{Greedy based acceleration of power estimation}
In previous sections, to find the optimal active core distribution which leads to highest performance-per-watt, for a $n$-core system with different active core numbers,  a combinational method with high complexity is implemented. However, it's  especially impractical when the number of cores is too big. Therefore, a greedy based method which can find a sub-optimal active core distribution with much less time consumption is applied.

For a $n$-core system with $n_{a}$ active cores, the basic idea of finding such sub-optimal solution is described as follows: we first find the optimal solution for only one active core. Next, we fix the first active core position determined by the first step, and find the optimal solution of two cores, with the second active core position determined. Please note that although we say “optimal” in the second step, such solution is only the optimal solution with the first active core fixed at the position determined by the first step, but not the true optimal solution for general two active cores. Similarly, in the ($i$ + 1)-th step, we look for the optimal solution for $i$ + 1 active cores with the positions of $i$ active cores found in all previous steps remain fixed. By proceeding such strategy for na steps, we can arrive at a sub-optimal solution for $n_{a}$ active cores.
